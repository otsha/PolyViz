Diary started on 16.9.

| Date | Hours spent | Worked on
|---|---|---|
| Before 16.9. | ~10-12h in total | 7-8 hours spent on wrestling with clock sync issues (turned out to be because of trying to play sound in a threaded function), another 1-2 h on the basics of the visualization aspect, rest on setting up the sequencer, instrument and scale classes |
