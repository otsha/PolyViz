Diary started on 16.9.

| Date | Hours spent | Worked on
|---|---|---|
| Before 16.9. | ~10-12h in total | 7-8 hours spent on wrestling with clock sync issues (turned out to be because of trying to play sound in a threaded function), another 1-2 h on the basics of the visualization aspect, rest on setting up the sequencer, instrument and scale classes |
| 18.9. | ~5h | Standardized note frequencies (A440Hz) to Note enum. Cleaning up & restructuring code so that less is done in setup(). Found a bug where lower bpm increased tempo - wrestling the bug without yet finding a solution bc math is difficult |
